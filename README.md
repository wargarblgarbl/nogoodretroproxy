# nogoodretroproxy

This is a no good retro proxy, moslty built for personal use to de-https the web. 

This will MITM any text-based file, and serve it up over a bog standard HTTP connection. Any links will be stripped and replaced with appropriately updated links to the proxy. 

Primarily built to proxy podcast feeds to old phones. 

It's bad, don't use it (see License)
